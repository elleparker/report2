Pragmatic, Technology-Driven Solution for 
Lebanon's Waste Crisis 
 
Introduction: Framing the Investment Opportunity – 
From National Crisis to Profitable Enterprise 
 
To address the inherent skepticism of any seasoned Lebanese investor, who is intimately familiar 
with a history of failed top-down initiatives and emergency plans (
1
), the Zbeleh.ai proposition is 
framed not as an idealistic panacea but as a pragmatic, market-driven response to a chronic and 
costly national failure. Lebanon's waste management sector is not merely a public service issue; it is 
a profound economic, environmental, and public health catastrophe (
2
). The country generates over 
2 million tons of solid waste annually, with over 80% being mismanaged through open dumping and 
burning, at an exorbitant cost of approximately $154.50 per ton—significantly higher than regional 
peers (
1
). This systemic collapse, exacerbated by political paralysis and economic turmoil, has left a 
vacuum where the state should be (
5
). 
This report posits that this very vacuum creates a significant and untapped economic opportunity. 
The core thesis is that the fragmentation and decentralization of Lebanon's waste sector, where 
management is relegated to the municipality level at best and is often an informal, private concern 
(
6
), makes it uniquely suited for a flexible, technology-enabled, and non-monolithic solution like 
Zbeleh.ai. The objective is not to replace the state, but to create the intelligent infrastructure for the 
de facto system that already exists. Zbeleh.ai is designed to organize the chaos, inject efficiency, 
and create value where there is currently only cost and contamination. 
The dual-track strategy, comprising a B2C Consumer Model and a B2B Enterprise Model, is 
presented not as a choice but as a synergistic approach that mitigates risk and creates a powerful, 
defensible ecosystem (
6
). The B2C model builds a grassroots network and tackles the problem from 
the bottom up, empowering citizens and the informal sector. Simultaneously, the B2B model 
provides a top-down solution for municipalities and large enterprises, addressing their critical need 
for cost control and operational efficiency. Together, they form a comprehensive, data-driven 
platform poised to become the central nervous system of Lebanon's future waste economy. 
 
Part I: The Zbeleh.ai B2C Consumer Model: Organizing 
Chaos, Creating Value 
 
Section 1.1: The B2C Competitive Arena – Mapping a Fragmented 
Ecosystem 
 

The B2C waste collection landscape in Lebanon is not a traditional market with clear incumbents but 
a fragmented ecosystem of digital pioneers, entrenched informal networks, and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). Understanding this complex interplay is fundamental to positioning Zbeleh.ai 
for success. 
 
Analysis of Direct Digital Competitors 
 
The most direct competitors are other mobile application-based services that have attempted to 
solve the collection puzzle. 
• Live Love Recycle (LLR): As the most significant direct competitor, LLR has demonstrated 
both the potential and the pitfalls of this model. Launched in the wake of the 2015 waste crisis, 
LLR operates as an NGO-driven, on-demand collection service using an app, initially with a 
fleet of e-bikes and later expanding to trucks (
4
). Its operational footprint has grown to include 
Beirut, Metn, Tripoli, and other areas, serving over 25,000 subscribers and collecting 
thousands of tons of waste since its inception (
7
). However, its operational model is its primary 
vulnerability. LLR is heavily dependent on external grants from entities like the World Food 
Programme (WFP) and the German government (BMZ), as well as crowdfunding campaigns 
(
8
). This reliance on philanthropy makes it inherently unsustainable and difficult to scale 
aggressively without a constant infusion of aid. Their reported plan to introduce a small fee of 
LBP 3,000 per pickup underscores a struggle for financial viability (
9
). Zbeleh.ai is positioned 
as the for-profit evolution of the LLR model—offering a more robust, scalable, and reliable 
service built on sound business principles, not precarious donor funding. 
• Nadeera: This startup presents a direct feature overlap with its AI-powered mobile app for 
identifying recyclables (
10
). However, its operational model appears to differ significantly. 
Nadeera focuses on partnerships with municipalities and guiding users to designated drop-off 
points, explaining 
what and where to recycle (
10
). This is a valuable educational tool but does not solve the core 
logistical problem of getting waste out of the home. Zbeleh.ai's value proposition is superior as 
it provides an end-to-end solution. While Nadeera’s AI tells a user 
if an item is recyclable, Zbeleh.ai’s AI will not only identify the material but also facilitate its 
immediate collection and create economic value through its integrated marketplace. 
 
Analysis of Informal & Indirect Competitors 
 
These are not traditional competitors but existing market players whose inefficiencies represent 
Zbeleh.ai's core opportunity. 
• The Informal Sector (Kabaris & Muallims): This is the bedrock of Lebanon's current 
recycling system and should be viewed as Zbeleh.ai's primary target user base and supply 
chain, not its competition. This sector is a complex, deeply entrenched network of street-level 
waste pickers (kabaris), often comprising migrant workers or underprivileged youth, who 
collect recyclables from bins and sell them to local scrapyard masters (muallims) (
11
). These 
individuals are micro-entrepreneurs providing essential labor for Lebanon's surprisingly 
successful scrap metal export industry (
12
). They operate within a chaotic, inefficient, and often 
exploitative system. Zbeleh.ai's platform is designed to empower them, not replace them. The 
app will serve as a powerful tool to increase their daily earnings through AI-optimized routes, 
direct access to a wider pool of households, and transparent pricing suggestions, transforming 
them from marginalized "scavengers" into dignified "logistics partners." 

• Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces (OLX, Facebook Groups): These platforms are the default 
solution for disposing of bulky waste like old furniture or electronics (
6
, p. 6). However, they are 
fraught with problems: transactions are inefficient, pricing is opaque and subject to haggling, 
and there are no mechanisms for trust, safety, or quality control. Zbeleh.ai offers a specialized, 
trusted, and efficient alternative. The platform professionalizes these one-off transactions by 
providing standardized job requests, AI-driven price suggestions based on item analysis, and 
a two-way rating system to build a community of trusted users and collectors. 
 
Role of Legacy NGOs & Potential Allies 
 
The NGO landscape is populated by organizations focused on awareness and sorting, creating a 
clear opportunity for partnership. 
• Recycle Lebanon / EcoSouk: This organization is a philosophical ally. Its focus is on 
systemic change, promoting a zero-waste lifestyle, and offering sustainable alternatives 
through its innovative retail hub, EcoSouk (
13
). They are not a competitor in the logistics space 
but a powerful potential partner for co-branded awareness campaigns and community 
outreach. 
• Arcenciel: As a major, established NGO with its own comprehensive collection and treatment 
programs, Arcenciel is a key player in the recycling value chain (
10
). The fact that LLR provides 
its collected recyclables to Arcenciel for free highlights Arcenciel's role as a major off-taker (
9
). 
Zbeleh.ai can establish a formal partnership with Arcenciel, directing a verified, pre-sorted 
stream of materials from its collection network to Arcenciel's facilities, thereby improving their 
operational efficiency. 
The NGO sector is primarily concerned with the "software" of waste management—awareness and 
behavior change. Zbeleh.ai provides the critical "hardware" and "operating system"—the efficient 
logistics and marketplace to connect sorted waste with recyclers. This complementary relationship 
forms the basis for collaboration, not conflict.

Section 1.2: Fortifying the B2C Proposition – A Blueprint for Adoption 
and Loyalty 
 
Building a successful B2C platform in Lebanon's uniquely challenging environment requires more 
than just good technology; it demands a sophisticated strategy for adoption, brand-building, and 
differentiation that is deeply attuned to local realities. 
 
High-Level SWOT Analysis for the B2C Model 
 
 
• Strengths: The model is asset-light, making it highly scalable with minimal capital expenditure 
compared to traditional waste management (
6
, p. 4). It directly addresses a daily frustration 
point for citizens, creating a strong pull factor. By formalizing and empowering the existing 
informal workforce, it has a positive social impact. 
• Weaknesses: The platform is subject to the classic "chicken-and-egg" problem of 
marketplaces: it needs a critical mass of both users and collectors to be viable (
6
, p. 4). 
Success is dependent on widespread smartphone penetration and a degree of technological 
literacy among both user groups. There is also a risk of resistance from established scrapyard 
middlemen ( 
muallims) who may see the platform as a threat to their control over the supply chain. 
• Opportunities: The target market is massive, chaotic, and completely underserved by 
technology (
6
, p. 12). There is a growing, albeit nascent, environmental consciousness among 
the public. In a market plagued by a deep trust deficit following decades of public and private 
sector failures (
1
), a brand that can verifiably deliver on its promises has an immense 
opportunity to build powerful loyalty. The platform will also generate unique and highly 
valuable data on consumption patterns. 
• Threats: The emergence of a better-funded direct competitor remains a possibility. Further 
economic collapse could depress household spending on any non-essential service, even a 
low-cost one. Unpredictable regulatory shifts, such as a sudden ban on certain types of 
collection activities, could disrupt operations. 
 
The Adoption & Growth Engine 
 

A meticulously planned launch is crucial to overcome the initial hurdle of achieving marketplace 
liquidity. 
• Hyper-local Launch Strategy: The go-to-market strategy will be surgical. All initial efforts will 
be concentrated on a single, dense, and demographically mixed neighborhood in Beirut, such 
as Achrafieh or Hamra. This approach, mirroring the playbook outlined in the initial deck (
6
, p. 
14), allows for the rapid achievement of marketplace density—a sufficient number of active 
users and collectors within a small geographic area to ensure prompt service and a positive 
feedback loop. This proves the model on a small scale before investing in wider expansion. 
• Onboarding the Collectors (Kabaris): This is the most critical success factor. The platform's 
supply side cannot be an afterthought; it must be actively cultivated. A dedicated onboarding 
program will be implemented, focusing on demonstrating clear value to the collectors: 
1. Financial Incentive: The core of the pitch to collectors will be a data-backed 
demonstration. Using simulations, the onboarding team will show how the app's AI-
optimized routing can increase their daily take-home pay by 20-30% by reducing time 
spent searching for pickups and minimizing travel distance between jobs. 
2. Tools & Legitimacy: To enhance their social acceptance and professionalize their 
work, collectors will be provided with Zbeleh.ai branded vests. Partnerships with 
microfinance institutions or NGOs will be explored to offer them access to better 
equipment, such as improved carts or trolleys. 
3. Simplicity and Accessibility: The collector-facing side of the application will be 
designed with extreme simplicity in mind, using intuitive, icon-based navigation that 
requires minimal literacy. It will be optimized to function reliably even in areas with poor 
mobile connectivity. 
• Viral User Acquisition: To drive demand, the strategy will leverage community dynamics and 
gamification: 
o Gamification: Launching "Clean Your Street" or "Neighborhood Recycling League" 
challenges where residents on a street or in a building compete to recycle the most. The 
winning group receives a tangible, sponsored prize—such as the planting of new trees 
on their street, a new public bench, or a community barbecue—generating positive 
press and organic word-of-mouth. 
o Dual-Sided Referral Program: A powerful growth hack will be a referral program that 
rewards users not only for referring new household users (e.g., with pickup credits) but 
also for referring new collectors. When a referred collector completes a certain number 
of jobs, the referring user receives a more substantial reward (e.g., cash or a larger 
credit), incentivizing the community to help build the platform's supply side. 
 
Building an Unbreakable Brand in a "Trust Vacuum" 
 
The Lebanese public is profoundly cynical, especially regarding services like waste management, 
which have been plagued by corruption, broken promises, and inefficiency for decades (
1
). Trust is 
the most valuable and scarcest currency. While competitors like LLR gained initial traction through 
their grassroots, non-profit appeal (
7
), Zbeleh.ai, as a for-profit entity, must build trust through a 
different mechanism: 
radical, verifiable transparency. 
The app's killer feature in this regard will be a "Trace Your Trash" function. After a pickup is 
completed, the user will receive a notification and be able to see on a map that their specific bag of 
recyclables was successfully delivered to a partner facility, for instance, "Recycling Plant X" or 
"Scrapyard Y." This closes the feedback loop and counters the common suspicion that sorted 
recyclables are just dumped with regular trash. It makes the abstract act of recycling tangible, 

verifiable, and rewarding, building a level of trust that no competitor can easily replicate. This 
feature, combined with community-level engagement—sponsoring local school environmental clubs, 
partnering with mukhtars, and maintaining a presence in neighborhood social media groups—will 
position Zbeleh.ai not as a faceless tech company, but as a reliable community partner. 
 
The AI Differentiator in Practice (Beyond the Buzzword) 
 
A skeptical Lebanese investor will rightly see "AI image recognition" as a potential gimmick (
6
, p. 10). 
The value of the AI must be demonstrated in practical, monetary terms. The informal market already 
knows what plastic is; their challenge lies in inefficient logistics and opaque pricing. Zbeleh.ai's AI 
provides the solution. 
The AI is engineered to be a dynamic pricing and logistics engine. 
• Dynamic Valuation: The computer vision model will be trained to go beyond simple 
identification. It won't just recognize a "plastic bottle"; it will be fine-tuned to classify it as "PET, 
Grade A" or "HDPE, Grade B." The platform will then cross-reference this classification with a 
real-time price list aggregated from partner recycling plants and major scrapyards. This 
instantly provides both the user and the collector with an estimated market value for the 
materials, transforming the app from a simple booking tool into a transparent commodity 
trading platform. 
• Predictive Hotspot Mapping: By analyzing aggregated user request data, pickup patterns, 
and even external data like public holidays or events, the AI's logistics engine will predict 
"trash hotspots"—areas where recyclable waste is likely to accumulate. It can then proactively 
push notifications to nearby collectors, suggesting they service these areas. This shifts the 
model from purely reactive (waiting for a request) to proactively efficient, maximizing the 
collector's earning potential per hour and ensuring cleaner neighborhoods. 
 
Section 1.3: B2C Monetization – Architecting Diverse and Resilient 
Revenue Streams 
 
A sustainable B2C model requires a multi-layered monetization strategy that captures value from 
different user segments and services, ensuring resilience in a volatile economic climate. 
 
Primary Revenue Models 
 
The primary models focus on direct transactional revenue from the core collection service. 
• Tiered Commission on Valuable Materials: For pickups of materials with established market 
value (e.g., aluminum, copper, e-waste, certain plastics), the platform will take a commission 
of 15-20% on the final transaction value paid to the collector (
6
, p. 13). This is a classic 
marketplace model where Zbeleh.ai only earns when it successfully facilitates a valuable 
transaction. 
• Fixed Convenience Fee (Pay-per-Pickup): Many recyclables, such as glass or mixed paper, 
have low or even negative value in Lebanon, making a commission model unviable. To ensure 
these materials are still collected, a small, fixed convenience fee (e.g., the equivalent of $1-2) 
will be charged to the user for the pickup service. This model, which LLR considered adopting 
(
9
), ensures the operational costs for the collector are covered and the platform remains 
sustainable across all material types. 

• Premium Subscriptions for SMEs: Small and medium-sized enterprises—such as 
restaurants, offices, and retail shops—have regular and predictable waste streams. Zbeleh.ai 
will offer a monthly subscription service for these businesses, providing scheduled pickups, 
dedicated support, and basic data reports on their recycling impact (
6
, p. 13). Subscription tiers 
can be based on the volume and frequency of collections, offering SMEs a hassle-free, 
budgetable solution for their waste management needs. 
 
Secondary & Tertiary Revenue Models (The AI Payoff) 
 
These models leverage the unique data and engagement capabilities of the platform to create high-
margin revenue streams. 
• Data Monetization: The platform will generate an unprecedented dataset on hyper-local 
consumption and disposal patterns. This aggregated and fully anonymized data is a highly 
valuable asset. It can be sold to market research firms, urban planners, and, most lucratively, 
to Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies. A report detailing that "In the Hamra 
district, Brand X's plastic water bottles constitute 15% of all collected plastic waste, while 
Brand Y's constitute 5%" provides invaluable, actionable intelligence for marketing, packaging 
design, and corporate strategy. 
• Sponsored Recycling Challenges: This model creates a direct B2B revenue stream through 
the B2C platform. Zbeleh.ai will partner with major brands (e.g., PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever) to 
create and host in-app recycling challenges. For example, a campaign could offer users 
rewards for recycling a certain number of a partner brand's products within a month. The 
brand pays Zbeleh.ai a fee to run the campaign and provide the prizes, gaining a powerful 
marketing tool that associates their brand with positive environmental action while driving user 
engagement on the app. 
• B2B2C for Corporate ESG: Zbeleh.ai will package its B2C service and sell it to large 
corporations as an employee benefit and a turnkey CSR initiative. The corporation pays a bulk 
subscription fee to subsidize or provide free at-home recycling pickups for its employees. In 
return, the company receives an aggregated, anonymized report on the collective 
environmental impact of its workforce (e.g., "Our employees collectively diverted 5 tons of 
plastic from landfills this year"), which can be used in their official ESG and sustainability 
reporting. 
 
B2C Revenue Projection Scenarios 
 
To make the revenue potential tangible for an investor, the following table models financial 
projections based on conservative, moderate, and aggressive user adoption scenarios, building 
upon the initial claim of a $1.5M+ annual revenue opportunity (

Section 1.4: The B2C Partnership Nexus – Beyond the Obvious 
 
To accelerate growth, reduce acquisition costs, and embed Zbeleh.ai into the economic fabric of 
Lebanon, a strategic partnership strategy is essential. This strategy must look beyond obvious 
players like municipalities and recycling plants. 
 
Retail & FMCG Sector 
 
 
• Partnership: The most strategic partnership lies in collaborating with major supermarket 
chains (e.g., Spinneys, Carrefour, TSC) and leading FMCG brands to create and manage 
"take-back" and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs. 
• Mechanism: When a user scans a product barcode from a partner brand within the Zbeleh.ai 
app, it could unlock a "free" or "subsidized" pickup for that packaging. This service would be 
funded by the brand as part of its CSR or marketing budget. This model aligns with emerging 
global trends in producer responsibility, provides a powerful new revenue stream for Zbeleh.ai, 
and offers immense value to consumers, directly incentivizing them to recycle specific 
products. 
 
Real Estate & Property Management 
 
 
• Partnership: Zbeleh.ai will be positioned as a premium amenity for high-end residential 
compounds, commercial office buildings, and new real estate developments. 
• Mechanism: The building's management or homeowners' association subscribes to a 
building-wide plan. This provides residents with seamless, integrated, and potentially free 
recycling services. In return, the building can market itself as a "Zbeleh.ai Certified Green 
Building," a tangible differentiator that can help attract environmentally conscious tenants and 
potentially justify higher rental or sale prices. 
 
Telecom Operators (Alfa, Touch) 
 
 

• Partnership: Leverage the massive user base and marketing channels of Lebanon's two main 
telecom operators for co-branding, loyalty program integration, or even app pre-installation on 
new devices. 
• Mechanism: A simple integration could allow telecom users to redeem their loyalty points for 
Zbeleh.ai pickup credits. Conversely, Zbeleh.ai could reward its most consistent recyclers with 
free mobile data, sponsored by the telecom partner. This creates a low-cost, high-visibility 
user acquisition channel and adds value to the telecom operator's loyalty program. 
 
Universities & Schools 
 
 
• Partnership: The engagement with academic institutions must evolve beyond simple 
awareness campaigns. Zbeleh.ai will forge deep partnerships with the environmental science, 
computer science, and business faculties of leading universities like the American University 
of Beirut (AUB), the Lebanese American University (LAU), and Université Saint-Joseph (USJ). 
• Mechanism: Zbeleh.ai will offer curated, anonymized datasets to students and researchers 
for academic projects on urban studies, consumer behavior, or waste management. The 
company can co-host hackathons and case competitions, challenging students to develop new 
AI features or business models for the platform. This strategy builds immense brand credibility 
within the academic and youth communities, provides a source of low-cost R&D, and 
establishes a direct pipeline for recruiting top-tier local talent. 
 
Part II: The Zbeleh.ai B2B Enterprise Model: The 
Irrefutable Case for Efficiency and Control 
 
Section 2.1: The B2B Competitive Arena – Challenging Incumbents and 
Foreign Giants 
 
The B2B landscape is dominated by a few large, traditional contractors and the long shadow of past 
failures. Zbeleh.ai's entry must be positioned as a paradigm shift from brute-force operations to data-
driven intelligence. 
 
Analysis of Incumbent Contractors 
 
 
• Ramco: As the current primary contractor for major service areas like Beirut and Metn & 
Keserwan, Ramco is the most visible incumbent (
16
). Their model is traditional, focusing on 
large-scale collection and street sweeping with a modern, European-made fleet of vehicles (
16
). 
Their primary weakness, however, is that their model is purely operational, not data-driven. 
They represent a "brute force" solution to waste collection. They are susceptible to the same 
systemic vulnerabilities as their predecessors: cripplingly high and volatile operational costs, 
particularly for fuel, and a fundamental lack of data-driven efficiency and transparency (
19
). This 

makes them highly vulnerable to a technology partner like Zbeleh.ai that can demonstrably 
and significantly lower those costs. 
• Sukleen/Averda Legacy: The ghost of Sukleen, now part of the international Averda group 
(
20
), looms large over the entire sector. Their two-decade tenure was marred by public 
accusations of maintaining a monopoly, charging inflated costs (reportedly up to $140/ton), 
opacity, and leveraging political patronage (
1
). This history has created a deep-seated and 
lasting public and official distrust of any single, large private entity aiming to control waste 
management. Zbeleh.ai must strategically distance itself from this legacy. The core message 
is clear: Zbeleh.ai is not another collection contractor seeking a monopoly. It is a technology 
provider that offers an intelligence layer to make 
any collection operation—whether it's a municipality's own fleet or a third-party contractor like 
Ramco—more efficient, transparent, and accountable. The pitch is one of empowerment and 
control, a direct antidote to the legacy of opacity. 
 
Benchmarking Against Global Precedents 
 
International success stories validate the technical and financial viability of the Zbeleh.ai model and 
provide powerful benchmarks for investors. 
• Compology (US): This is the most direct and compelling global precedent. Compology uses 
bin-mounted cameras and AI-powered software to monitor fullness, location, and content, 
which in turn enables dynamic route optimization (
23
). Their value proposition is proven and 
quantifiable: they have demonstrated the ability to reduce client collection costs by up to 40% 
and slash contamination rates in recycling streams by as much as 80% (
24
). Their business 
model, which involves partnerships with waste haulers, Fortune 100 companies, and 
government entities, is precisely what Zbeleh.ai aims to replicate. The pitch to investors will 
frame Zbeleh.ai as "Compology, adapted for Lebanon"—emphasizing greater affordability 
through local partnerships for hardware, enhanced durability for the local environment, and a 
feature set tailored to the specific pain points of Lebanese municipalities, such as fuel costs 
and public pressure. 
• Junker (Italy): The Junker app's business model provides strong validation for Zbeleh.ai's 
proposed B2B2C integration. Junker's revenue comes from municipalities paying a 
subscription fee to have their specific, localized recycling rules and collection point information 
integrated into the consumer-facing app (
25
). This proves that municipalities are willing to pay 
for a digital tool that facilitates better citizen engagement and improves sorting-at-source, a 
key component of the integrated Zbeleh.ai vision. 
 
Local Engineering & IoT Firms 
 
Currently, there are no known local Lebanese firms offering a comprehensive, integrated smart 
waste management platform. The local tech landscape consists of potential partners, not 
competitors. Firms specializing in hardware assembly, IoT device installation, and field maintenance 
can be integrated into Zbeleh.ai's supply chain. This presents a significant advantage, allowing 
Zbeleh.ai to be framed not as a foreign tech importer but as a catalyst for growth and job creation 
within Lebanon's local tech and engineering sectors. 
 
Section 2.2: Fortifying the B2B Proposition – The Case for Political and 
Financial Survival 

 
To secure contracts with Lebanese municipalities and large enterprises, the proposition must 
transcend environmental benefits and speak directly to their most pressing concerns: financial 
survival, operational control, and political viability. 
 
High-Level SWOT Analysis for the B2B Model 
 
 
• Strengths: The solution addresses a massive, high-cost, and non-discretionary pain point for 
every municipality. The Return on Investment (ROI) is clear, quantifiable, and rapid. The SaaS 
model creates predictable, long-term recurring revenue. The entire proposition is aligned with 
national legislation (Law 80/2018 on Integrated Solid Waste Management) and the strategic 
goals of international donors like the World Bank and USAID (
27
). 
• Weaknesses: The model requires significant initial capital expenditure for hardware 
manufacturing and deployment (
6
, p. 4). Sales cycles with government entities are notoriously 
long, bureaucratic, and susceptible to political interference (
29
). The physical hardware 
(sensors) is vulnerable to vandalism, theft, and harsh environmental conditions (
6
, p. 34). 
• Opportunities: There is a significant first-mover advantage, with no direct local competitor 
offering a similar integrated solution (
6
, p. 33). The platform has the potential to become the 
de-facto national standard for waste data and management. There are clear pathways to 
secure non-dilutive funding through international grants targeted at environmental and 
municipal reform (
30
). The model is highly replicable and scalable to other cities in the MENA 
region facing similar challenges. 
• Threats: Pervasive political instability could derail municipal decision-making and budget 
allocation indefinitely. The arrival of a heavily subsidized international competitor could disrupt 
the market. A failure in the initial pilot programs to deliver the promised, undeniable ROI would 
be a major setback. 
 
The Unmistakable ROI: The Core Pitch 
 
Municipal leaders in Lebanon are not primarily motivated by technological innovation or 
environmental stewardship. Their decisions are driven by two overwhelming factors: extreme 
financial pressure and intense political pressure from their constituents (
5
). The single largest, most 
volatile, and politically sensitive line item in their waste management budget is the cost of fuel for 
collection trucks (
19
). Therefore, the pitch to any municipality or large enterprise must lead with the 
most compelling and immediate financial benefit. 
The opening statement will be direct and powerful: "Our platform can reduce your fleet's fuel 
consumption and associated maintenance costs by up to 40%, with a payback period of less 
than 12 months." This pitch leverages the 40% efficiency gain benchmark set by global leaders like 
Compology (
24
) and frames the Zbeleh.ai system not as an expense, but as a self-funding investment 
in fiscal survival. The conversation starts with cost-cutting and budget relief; the significant 
environmental and public health benefits are then presented as powerful co-benefits that enhance 
the value proposition. 
 
The AI Differentiator as a Governance Tool 
 

The AI-powered dashboard is far more than an operational tool for route optimization; it is a 
sophisticated platform for governance, compliance, and public relations. 
• Automated Contamination Alerts: The sensor's integrated camera will use a computer 
vision model (similar to academic projects like ContamiNet 
6
, p. 33) to detect significant 
contamination in recycling bins (e.g., a bag of organic waste in a plastics bin). It can 
automatically flag the contamination event, log the location, and alert the municipal authorities. 
This allows them to identify problem hotspots for targeted awareness campaigns or even 
implement a system of warnings and fines, which both improves the quality (and thus, the 
value) of their collected recyclables and creates a potential new revenue stream. 
• Predictive Analytics for Urban Planning: The platform's real-time data on waste generation 
rates—broken down by district, street, and even building type—provides an unprecedented 
level of insight for municipal planning. This data is critical for compliance with the mandates of 
Law 80/2018 (
28
) and for providing the detailed reporting required by international funding 
bodies like the World Bank and UNDP (
27
). 
• "The Mayor's Dashboard": A key deliverable will be a simplified, public-facing version of the 
dashboard that can be embedded on the municipality's official website. This dashboard will 
display key performance indicators in real-time for all citizens to see: "This month, our 
community saved X liters of fuel, conducted Y fewer truck trips, and prevented Z bins from 
overflowing." This transforms the platform from a back-office system into a powerful tool for 
transparency and building political capital, allowing elected officials to demonstrably prove 
their effectiveness to their constituents. 
 
Overcoming Inertia and Risk 
 
 
• De-risking through Piloting: The go-to-market strategy will mitigate the risk of municipal 
inertia by targeting one or two progressive municipalities for a heavily subsidized or entirely 
free 6-month pilot program (
6
, p. 30). The ideal pilot partners would be municipalities already 
engaged with or receiving funding from international bodies (e.g., through the USAID 
DAWERR program 
31
), as they are more likely to be open to innovation and have reporting 
requirements that our platform can meet. The sole objective of the pilot is to generate an 
undeniable, locally-validated case study that proves the ROI claims. 
• Leveraging International Funding Channels: Zbeleh.ai will be actively positioned to align 
with the objectives of major international aid programs, such as USAID's DAWERR project (
33
) 
and World Bank environmental grants (
30
). The platform can be pitched to these organizations 
as the perfect technology backbone to ensure their funds are deployed efficiently and with 
measurable, verifiable impact. The goal is to have Zbeleh.ai become a preferred or even 
required technology vendor for municipalities seeking to access these funds. 
• Hardware Resilience and Security: The pitch must proactively address the valid concern of 
hardware vandalism and theft (
6
, p. 34). The sensors will be designed in Lebanon for Lebanon: 
extremely robust, weather-proof, and as discreet as possible. They will be equipped with 
tamper alerts that notify the central platform if a unit is being interfered with. Furthermore, the 
SaaS business model will include a comprehensive maintenance and replacement plan, 
ensuring the municipality is not left with broken hardware. 
 
Section 2.3: B2B Monetization – Structuring for Long-Term, Scalable 
Contracts 
 

The B2B monetization strategy is designed to be flexible, offering multiple entry points for clients 
with varying budgetary constraints and creating a foundation for long-term, scalable recurring 
revenue. 
 
The Core SaaS Model 
 
The primary revenue stream is a tiered monthly Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription fee, 
charged on a per-sensor basis (
6
, p. 29). This model ensures predictable revenue and aligns the cost 
with the scale of the client's operation. 
• Tier 1 (Basic Monitoring): Provides real-time fill-level data from ultrasonic sensors and basic 
overflow alerts. This is the entry-level package for cost-sensitive clients. 
• Tier 2 (Professional Optimization): Includes all Tier 1 features plus the AI-powered route 
optimization engine and access to a standard analytics dashboard showing historical data and 
basic efficiency metrics. 
• Tier 3 (Enterprise Intelligence): The premium offering. It includes all Tier 2 features plus the 
AI-powered camera vision for contamination detection, predictive analytics for forecasting 
waste generation, API access for integration with existing municipal systems (e.g., ERP, 
billing), and the customizable public-facing "Mayor's Dashboard." 
 
Innovative & Hybrid Models (The Partnership Approach) 
 
Recognizing the severe financial constraints facing many Lebanese municipalities (
5
), Zbeleh.ai will 
offer innovative models that lower upfront risk and align financial incentives. 
• Gain-Share Model: This is a powerful de-risking tool for hesitant clients. Zbeleh.ai charges a 
significantly lower fixed monthly SaaS fee in exchange for a pre-agreed percentage (e.g., 30-
50%) of the documented monthly cost savings generated by the system. Savings on fuel, 
vehicle maintenance, and overtime pay would be tracked by the platform, and the "gain" would 
be shared. This model means Zbeleh.ai only profits significantly when the client profits 
significantly. 
• Recyclables Revenue Share: For municipalities that use the full suite of Zbeleh.ai tools 
(including the citizen engagement app) to improve sorting-at-source, the platform can track the 
improved quality and quantity of collected recyclables. Zbeleh.ai can then take a percentage of 
the additional revenue the municipality generates from selling these higher-value materials to 
recycling facilities. 
• Platform White-Labeling: This creates a highly scalable, indirect sales channel. Zbeleh.ai 
can license its entire technology stack to large, private waste contractors (a more forward-
thinking version of Ramco or even Averda for their regional operations). These contractors can 
then offer the smart waste solution to their own municipal and corporate clients under their 
own brand, paying Zbeleh.ai a licensing fee per end-user or sensor. 
 
Value-Added Services 
 
 
• ESG & Compliance-as-a-Service: Large corporate clients (malls, hospitals, industrial plants, 
hotel chains) are increasingly under pressure to report on their environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG) performance. Zbeleh.ai will offer a premium consulting service that uses 

the rich data from the platform to generate automated, audit-ready ESG and sustainability 
reports, saving clients significant time and consulting fees. 
• The National Waste Intelligence Grid: The ultimate long-term vision is to aggregate all 
anonymized data from B2C and B2B operations into a national waste intelligence grid (
6
, p. 
37). This unique and invaluable dataset would be offered on a subscription basis to key 
national and international stakeholders, including the Ministry of Environment, the World Bank, 
UNDP, university research centers, and large private sector players seeking macro-level 
insights into the Lebanese economy. 
 
Section 2.4: The B2B Partnership Nexus – An Ecosystem of Credibility 
and Scale 
 
Strategic partnerships are crucial for navigating the complexities of the B2B market in Lebanon, 
accelerating sales cycles, and building an ecosystem of credibility. 
 
International Development & Funding Agencies (World Bank, UNDP, USAID) 
 
 
• Partnership: Position Zbeleh.ai as a "Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL)" Partner. 
• Mechanism: International agencies invest millions in waste management projects across 
Lebanon but often struggle to accurately measure their real-world impact and ensure funds 
are used efficiently (
30
). The Zbeleh.ai platform provides the perfect solution: a real-time, data-
driven tool for tracking every aspect of a waste management intervention, from collection 
efficiency to recycling rates. By embedding the Zbeleh.ai platform into their grant requirements 
as a mandatory MEL component, these agencies can ensure accountability and data-driven 
results, while Zbeleh.ai gains unparalleled access to pre-qualified municipal clients and a de-
risked sales cycle. 
 
Financial Institutions (Byblos Bank, Bank Audi, Fransabank, etc.) 
 
 
• Partnership: Create dedicated "Green Infrastructure" financing packages for municipalities 
and large enterprises. 
• Mechanism: Lebanese banks are actively seeking credible CSR initiatives and green 
financing opportunities to bolster their portfolios and public image (
37
). Zbeleh.ai will partner 
with these banks to offer favorable, low-interest loans specifically designed to cover the 
upfront hardware and installation costs of its system. The loan repayment schedule can be 
structured to be paid directly from the operational savings our system generates, effectively 
making the project self-funding from the client's perspective and creating a win-win-win 
scenario for the client, the bank, and Zbeleh.ai. 
 
Insurance Companies (e.g., Medgulf, Allianz SNA, Bankers) 
 
 

• Partnership: Develop a "Certified Green Risk" program that translates sustainable practices 
into financial benefits. 
• Mechanism: Improper waste management poses significant liabilities, including fire hazards 
from overflowing bins, public health risks, and environmental contamination. Zbeleh.ai can 
work with insurers to demonstrate that a business or municipality using its platform has a 
measurably lower risk profile. This data-backed risk reduction could qualify clients for lower 
insurance premiums, creating another powerful and unique financial incentive for them to 
adopt the Zbeleh.ai system. 
 
Local Manufacturing & Engineering Sector 
 
 
• Partnership: Establish a local supply chain for hardware assembly, installation, and 
maintenance. 
• Mechanism: Instead of importing fully assembled and costly sensor units, Zbeleh.ai will 
partner with a reputable local electronics or light manufacturing firm. This partner will handle 
the final assembly of sensor components, quality assurance testing, and deployment. This 
strategy significantly lowers hardware costs, reduces import dependencies, creates skilled 
local jobs (a major selling point in any pitch to Lebanese officials), and ensures a rapid, on-
the-ground response network for maintenance and support. 
 
Conclusion: The Winning Formula – A Synthesized, 
Dual-Track Vision for a Cleaner Lebanon 
 
The analysis of the Lebanese waste sector and the strategic fortification of the Zbeleh.ai concept 
reveal a clear path to creating a winning investment formula. The key element, which elevates this 
venture from a mere product to a defensible ecosystem, is the profound synergy between the B2C 
and B2B models. Zbeleh.ai is not two separate business ideas operating in parallel; it is one 
integrated, intelligent ecosystem designed to attack Lebanon's waste crisis from both the top-down 
and the bottom-up. 
This integrated vision directly addresses the final critical question: have we missed anything? The 
missing link was the articulation of this powerful flywheel effect. 
• The B2B Enterprise Platform provides municipalities with the tools for operational efficiency 
and cost control, giving them the financial breathing room and data-driven governance they 
desperately need. 
• This, in turn, allows them to sponsor or subsidize the B2C Consumer App for their residents, 
creating a direct channel for citizen engagement, promoting sorting-at-source, and fulfilling the 
public service mandate of a cleaner environment. 
• The data from the B2C app—for example, identifying which materials citizens find most 
confusing to sort—feeds directly back into the B2B dashboard, allowing the municipality to run 
highly targeted and effective awareness campaigns. 
• The B2C marketplace, by empowering and organizing the informal collector network, creates a 
reliable and efficient offtake channel for the very recyclables that the integrated B2B-B2C 
system helps to separate and aggregate. 
The final investment thesis is therefore one of a uniquely resilient and pragmatic venture, 
meticulously designed for the Lebanese reality. It does not fight against the existing informal 
economy but empowers it. It does not require a functional central state but provides undeniable 

financial and political value to the decentralized authorities that hold de facto power. It creates a 
virtuous cycle where data from one side of the platform strengthens the other, building a moat of 
network effects and proprietary intelligence that will be difficult for any competitor to replicate. 
An investment in Zbeleh.ai is not a speculative bet on a single product. It is an investment in a 
scalable, profitable, and deeply impactful solution to one of Lebanon's most persistent and visible 
crises. It is an opportunity to build the foundational infrastructure for the country's emerging circular 
economy.
