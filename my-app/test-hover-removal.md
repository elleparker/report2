# Bar Chart Hover Behavior Test Results

## Changes Made:

### 1. Removed hover behaviors from motion components:
- ✅ Removed `whileHover` props from `TestAnimatedBar` component in `ChartPerformanceTest.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `onHoverStart` and `onHoverEnd` listeners from commented AnimatedBar component in `Charts.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `whileHover` props from motion.div elements in `page.tsx`

### 2. Deleted CSS "NUCLEAR OPTION" block:
- ✅ Removed entire CSS block that forced `pointer-events: none` on chart elements
- ✅ Removed all hover-specific CSS overrides for recharts elements
- ✅ Removed color-specific hover rules

### 3. Fixed CSS syntax error:
- ✅ Removed accidentally included JavaScript code from `globals.css`

## Test Results:

1. **Bar Charts in Charts.tsx**:
   - WasteCompositionChart: Uses standard recharts Bar components with `isAnimationActive={false}`
   - RevenueProjectionChart: Uses standard recharts Bar components with `isAnimationActive={false}`
   - No hover animations or color changes

2. **ChartPerformanceTest.tsx**:
   - TestAnimatedBar component no longer has hover behaviors
   - Static rendering for large datasets (>100 items)
   - Animation only affects initial load, not hover

3. **Page.tsx**:
   - Motion divs in executive summary section no longer scale on hover
   - Only CSS transitions remain for border color changes

## Verification:
- Development server runs without errors
- Hovering over bar charts shows no visual changes
- Tooltips still work correctly (as they should)
- No pointer-events restrictions that could break tooltips

## Summary:
All hover/pointer behaviors have been successfully removed from bar charts while preserving tooltip functionality. The CSS "NUCLEAR OPTION" block has been completely deleted.
